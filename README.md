# RetroPie-es-theme-pipboy1
This repository contains the EmulationStation theme "pipboy1" Fallout Pip-Boy Theme.
Based on https://github.com/mattrixk/es-theme-spare.
I made this  Pip-boy theme for a custom Pip-Boy I am building. 
This es theme will give the emulationstation the appearance of the pip-boy main menu. 
I am currently working on adding Fallout 4 main theme music to es theme. 
I am new to github, so I am not sure what all I am suppose to add here.
Any suggestions on how to improve this respository or es theme please send me a message. 
Enjoy!
